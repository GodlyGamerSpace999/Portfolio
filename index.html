      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, this is Nihar Jain. I was born in Pune, Maharashtra, India on December 8, 2008. I live in Manteca, California with my dad, mom, and twin sisters.
        I love reading lots of books, but mostly fantasy and mystery. My favorite authors are J.K. Rowling, Rick Riordan, and Shannon Messenger.
        I enjoy playing video games on my PS4 and computer. Some of my favorite games are Minecraft, Spiderman, and Horizon Zero Dawn. I like watching gaming videos by DanTDM, Mr. Beast, Dream, Loverfella, and Skip the Tutorial.
        I'm fascinated with technology, and enjoy playing with new gadgets. I also like to keep myself updated on new devices that come out.</p>
        <p>Recently, I've been interested in cryptocurrency and the stock market. One of my favorite cryptocurrencies is the meme currency, Dogecoin.
        I moved to the U.S. when I was four and a half years old and I've had lots of challenges and experiences.
        I want to use this platform to record my achievements and share my progress with friends and family.</p>
